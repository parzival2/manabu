From here you can only download QtCreator IDE without downloading the Qt framework.\nCreate Workspace and Compiling Our Package Create a catkin-workspace if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so by running\nmkdir catkin_ws cd catkin_ws mkdir src catkin_make Then create a package using\ncatkin_create_pkg package_name std_msgs roscpp Finally compile the package using\ncatkin_make Setting up QtCreator Actually, there is little to setup. The QtCreator works with ROS out of the box but I had some trouble. It also messes up the ROS build environment too which will have been created using catkin-make. For this step to work, we need to build the project at least once so that QtCreator can find the correct build folders. For QtCreator to load the environment variables provided in ~/.bashrc, we need to launch it by creating a custom .desktop file.\nPaste the following contents in to a file on the desktop named appropriately, QtCreator.desktop\n[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Exec=bash -i -c \u0026quot;/home/kalyan/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator\u0026quot; %F Name=Qt Creator GenericName=The IDE of choice for Qt development.

As soon as you do that, you can launch QtCreator by double-clicking on it.\nLaunch the QtCreator and open the CMakeLists.txt in ~catkin_ws\\src folder.\nNow, de-select all the Temporary Kit and select the QtDesktop Kit that you have already setup.\nSetup the build type of your choice and most importantly select the build folder found in your workspace as the path to the build folder as shown in the following screenshot.\n","permalink":"https://parzival2.github.io/manabu.github.io/posts/qtcreator-ros/","summary":"I have tried many IDEs and found that QtCreator is the one that I like.
