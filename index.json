[{"content":"Adding images in Hugo I had a lot of trouble adding images in Hugo and searched a lot on the internet and finally solved the problem.

So I wanted to setup QtCreator for ROS development.\nPrerequisites Installing ROS I assume that you have already installed ROS on your operating system. If not you can follow these instructions\nInstalling QtCreator An open-sourced version of QtCreator can be downloaded from here. From here you can only download QtCreator IDE without downloading the Qt framework.\nCreate Workspace and Compiling Our Package Create a catkin-workspace if you haven\u0026rsquo;t done so by running\nmkdir catkin_ws cd catkin_ws mkdir src catkin_make Then create a package using\ncatkin_create_pkg package_name std_msgs roscpp Finally compile the package using\ncatkin_make Setting up QtCreator Actually, there is little to setup. The QtCreator works with ROS out of the box but I had some trouble. It also messes up the ROS build environment too which will have been created using catkin-make. For this step to work, we need to build the project at least once so that QtCreator can find the correct build folders. For QtCreator to load the environment variables provided in ~/.bashrc, we need to launch it by creating a custom .desktop file.\nPaste the following contents in to a file on the desktop named appropriately, QtCreator.desktop\n[Desktop Entry] Type=Application Exec=bash -i -c \u0026quot;/home/kalyan/Qt/Tools/QtCreator/bin/qtcreator\u0026quot; %F Name=Qt Creator GenericName=The IDE of choice for Qt development.
